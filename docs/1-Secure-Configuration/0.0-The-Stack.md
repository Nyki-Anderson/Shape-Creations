## The Docker Stack  
  
For Shape Creations, we will use Docker to run four separate services or containers: namely, (1) Apache, (2) PHP, (3) MariaDB, and (4) PHPMyAdmin. Each of these will be isolated Docker services that communicate through a shared network. We will get into this dynamic more later, but we will also be utilizing Dockerfiles and Docker Compose to orchestrate all of these services. Instead of a separate module or section introducing these topics, we will actively learn them as we go.  
  
The rest of this module will contain a section for the initial configuration of each of the four Docker services. We will harden each service in the next module but security will be a key focus throughout the project; returning to our images and containers as needed.  
  
### Services We Need  
  
1. [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) is an open source web server project that has been around forever. Most tutorials I found when starting this project were centered around Nginx, another web server service. I am very comfortable with Apache and find its configuration to be more extensible and customizable. We will be configuring our Apache server to use HTTPS using SSL certificate verification and a virtual host, as well as serve PHP scripts.  
2. [PHP](https://www.php.net/) is a web-development programming language. Specifically, we will be using [PHP-FPM](https://www.php.net/) which is especially built for handling multiple tasks using quickly using a concept called pools. It will be our logic-handler. Most of the project will be scripted using PHP (though of course HTML and CSS) will be used to flesh out the site itself.  
3. [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/) is an open source relational, SQL-based database infrastructure, with a focus on security and scalability. It uses a similar query syntax to MySQL, though we will require little knowledge of this language thanks to PHPMyAdmin.  
4. [PHPMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) is a web-based GUI for managing MySQL and MariaDB databases. It will not be a “permanent” service, as we will only run the container as needed to create and design our database structure.  
  
## Docker Workflow  
  
Now that we’re starting the Shape Creations project, we have a massive task ahead of us. We will break it up into many smaller pieces in each module and section. Following along now will be important as many of the steps unfold in parallel.  
  
> 🌎 The Big Picture    
> I will attempt to simplify this project by showing “complete” code ahead of showing the steps that lead up to it. Look for these big picture admonitions throughout.  
  
We will start by building out a `Dockerfile` for each image. Then, we will use Docker Compose to configure and run containers built from those images. Each container will need to “communicate” with the others (preferably only the services that need to talk to each other will be connected for security purposes) though each service will be standalone.  
  
> 🔒 Security    
>This is an industry standard in place to reduce the impact of a breach into any one service. The other services will be protected and there will be less an attacker can access.  
  
> 🔮 Crystal Ball    
> Once our Docker services all have running containers that communicate between each other, we will begin the build out of the actual site itself. More on that in Module 3.  
  
### Dockerfiles  
  
Since we will need custom configurations for all of our images, we will be using [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#:~:text=Docker%20can%20build%20images%20automatically,can%20use%20in%20a%20Dockerfile%20.). Any Docker image found on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) uses a `dockerfile` to implement startup images. This can include installing built in programs, copying over external configuration files, setting a working directory, permissions, etc. We will be learning the syntax for such a file and configuring our images upfront in this way.  
  
> 🔦 Flashback    
> If you recall from [Module 1 - Section 03](../0-Getting-Started/0.3-Docker-Primer.md#learning-the-lingo) images are made up of read-only layers that we then run a container from. As such, everything that goes in the `Dockerfile` will become embedded in these read-only layers.  
  
The result of these dockerfiles will be a custom configured image with all of the programs and configuration baked-in. We will also copy over the files from the project itself so certain containers have access to our live code but more on this later.  
  
### Docker Compose  
  
We will be implementing each of the services listed earlier in order as much as possible though a lot of the process is intertwined.  
  
> ✏ Note    
> We will need some services to check if others are working. So we will do a lot of ground work, then fine tune.  
  
This will be made very easy using something called a `docker-compose.yml` file which will orchestrate all of the services without needing long, drawn out command line entries. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is now an extension of Docker itself and has its own syntax. You can get help for any `docker compose` commands using the `--help` flag just as with any other Docker command.  
  
```shell  
$ docker compose --help  
```  
  
While Docker Compose relieves us of the need to use Docker fully in the command line, I will attempt to show the equivalent commands to give us some perspective on how helpful the tool really is. In the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/103Ia0/) I’ve mentioned before, you learn the whole command line before getting to use Docker Compose which I believe is invaluable to the process. I would do that here but it would take another whole module and that’s not what you’re here for so I’ve elected to approach the subject through the project at hand.    
  
## Docker File Tree  
  
Make a folder called `ShapeCreations` (or whatever your project name is) and make the following directory structure: a folder name `.config` and another folder named `.dockerfiles`. You may also wish to make the nested folders as seen in the directory tree below.  
  
> ✏ Note    
> The `.` in front of the folder names causes them to be “hidden” directories which really only helps us keep them at the top of the directory structure.  
  
```shell  
├── .config  
│   ├── apache-conf  
│   │   ├── extra  
│   │   │   ├── ssl.conf  
│   │   │   └── vhosts.conf

├── .dockerfiles  
│   ├── apache.dockerfile  
│   ├── mariadb.dockerfile  
│   └── php-fpm.dockerfile  
├── .dockerignore  
├── .env  
```  
  
> 🔮 Crystal Ball    
> This was a short section just to set a course for where we’re going. We will start right in with the the initial Dockerfile image configurations in the [0.2-Apache-Image](../1-Docker-Configuration/0.2-Apache-Image.md#) section.
