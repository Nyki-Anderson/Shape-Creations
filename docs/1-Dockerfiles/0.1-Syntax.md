## Dockerfile Syntax  
  
The above `apache.dockerfile` may seem overwhelming right now, but I will work to demystify it now. Before we start, let’s go through definition hell for each instruction type used in a Dockerfile. For a complete reference, check out the [Docker - Dockerfile Reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).  
  
### General Rules  
  
Docker syntax is quite simple at its core. Comments are denoted with a `#` symbol and each command must be on its own line. While not required, all instructions are typically written using ALL CAPS.  
  
```Dockerfile  
# This is a comment  
FROM apache  
```  
  
Since we are writing the instructions to build a nicely packaged Docker image. Each new instruction denotes another layer in the image and will build in order.  
  
> 🔮 Crystal Ball    
> There are some exceptions to this new layer rule that I will point out when we get there.  
  
There are some considerations to be had when deciding when and where we put certain instructions. This is because when we build our images, a cache helps keep track of what has changed from the present build to the previous, then only building layers that have changed starting from the first change.  
  
In practice, this means putting instructions that copy code subject to change near the end and simple installations near the beginning so that we don’t have to rebuild installation layers each time a configuration file is changed.  
  
> 🦺 Security    
> Remember, each layer in an image can be inspected with a simple command! Our layers should not contain any secrets or otherwise sensitive information. We will discuss how to get around this soon.  
  
#### Naming the File  
  
Dockerfiles are usually named `dockerfile` (or some version of that). This helps, especially for VS Code to help auto suggestions. We will be using the `{service_name}.dockerfile` convention in our project as VS Code recognizes it.  
  
> 🔮 Crystal Ball    
 > We want VS Code to recognize these files because it will help us select valid base image variants and versions as well as help with syntax.  
  
#### The `FROM` Instruction  
  
Every Dockerfile needs a `FROM...` instruction at the beginning of the file. This is like the `docker pull` command on the CLI. In general, you can use any base image from the Docker Hub, but there are often variants and specific versions that can be specified.  
  
> ✏ Note    
> It is good practice to specify both of these things in our Dockerfiles as it will protect us from unforeseen differences between versions that can break our builds.  
  
Dockerfiles can be as simple as a `FROM` instruction but if this is all you need, you may as well build your image from the CLI. Nothing can precede a `FROM` instruction except comments or `ARG` instructions.  
  
#### Variable Replacement: The `ARG` & `ENV` Instructions  
  
So I mentioned before that there are some exceptions to the layer per instruction rule. Two of those exceptions are the `ARG` and `ENV` instructions. These instructions are used to pass variables into our image build. We will discuss each individually as they should be used for two distinct purposes. Their shared purpose though is to prevent having to hardcode values that might otherwise be different for different image builds (e.g., development vs. production).  
  
##### `ARG`  
  
> 🔦 Flashback    
> As mentioned in the `FROM` instruction heading, the `ARG` instruction is the only instruction that can precede it and the `ARG` itself must only be referenced in that `FROM` instruction, as for, the variant or version number. For example:  
>  
> ```Dockerfile  
> ARG VERSION=2.4.57  
> FROM httpd:${VERSION}  
> ```  
  
##### `ENV`  
  
The `ENV` instruction is used to replace values used in other Dockerfile instructions. Though we don’t use the `ENV` instruction in this tutorial (we use a `.env` file instead) it is important to know that this is technically what we are doing. Variables are often named using ALL CAPS and the syntax for `ENV` variables is as such:  
  
```Dockerfile  
ENV VARIABLE_NAME=value  
  
RUN some_command ${VARIABLE_NAME}  
```
