## Visual Studio Code  
  
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode) is just as impressive as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Similarly the “Extension” building community is highly active and it is capable of being your one stop shop for all your hard-skill programming needs. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can compile, run, debug, automate (and so much more) nearly any programming language. You can even use Markdown Language and push `.md` files to Github without needing [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) at all but I realized that for project management I require some bells and whistles that I don’t find easily in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).    
  
> 🔦 Flashback    
> Although it is certainly not your next IDE (Integrated Development Environment), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) has a plugin called [Execute Code](https://github.com/twibiral/obsidian-execute-code) that allows you to run code within a note! This is great for quick examples and comes in handy when you don’t want to create a new project in your IDE for a couple lines of code.  
  
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the most robust IDE on the market and it is now available to download for any operating system. Plus, you can define multiple scopes or workspaces to specialize an environment for each language or project with which you work. Let’s get started by installing  
  
> 🌎 Big Picture    
>It is important to remember with all these tools that they were meant to be extremely customizable. Half the fun of choosing your tools is making them work for you. A well configured tool can make your life and the life of your project immeasurably easier. Consider spending some time on this step. It will pay off in the end!  
  
My preferred configuration starts with opening a folder in
