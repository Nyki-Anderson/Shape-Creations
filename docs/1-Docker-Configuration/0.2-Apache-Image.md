## Hitting the Ground Running  
  
So there are still a lot of Docker that we have yet to see. In this module, we will learn about Dockerfiles as we design our Apache image. This will be the longest section of the Dockerfile Module mainly because we will have to learn how to setup a `dockerfile` in the first place. So without further ado, let’s start running!  
  
## Our Apache Image  
  
> 🌎 The Big Picture    
> Before we get started, here’s what our complete Apache `apache.dockerfile` will look like and it should be included in the `.dockerfiles` folder. This is the state of the `apache.dockerfile` as it is at the end of this Module. The full Dockerfile, if amended, is of course available at `.dockerfiles/apache.dockerfile` in the main project directory.  
  
```dockerfile  
ARG APACHE_VERSION  
ARG ALPINE VERSION  
  
FROM httpd:${APACHE_VERSION}-alpine${ALPINE_VERSION}  
  
RUN apk update --no-cache; \  
	apk upgrade --no-cache;  
  
WORKDIR /usr/local/apache2  
  
## Add Low-Privilege User and Grant Permissions  
ARG USER  
ARG GROUP  
ARG UID  
ARG APP_NAME  
ARG VIRTUAL_HOST  
  
## Create Non-Root User and Group & Set Priveleges for User  
RUN addgroup -S -g ${UID} ${GROUP} \  
	&& adduser -S -D -u ${UID} -s --disabled-password --gecos "" --no-create-home -G ${GROUP} ${USER} \  
	&& mkdir -p ./htdocs/${VIRTUAL_HOST}/public_html \  
	&& chown -R ${UID}:${UID} ./logs ./conf ./htdocs/${VIRTUAL_HOST}/public_html  
  
ARG UID  
  
## Set Non-Root User Created Above  
USER ${UID}  
  
ARG APACHE_CONFIG  
  
## Replace Config File in Container  
COPY ${APACHE_CONFIG}/httpd.conf ./conf/httpd.conf  
COPY ${APACHE_CONFIG}/extra/ssl.conf ./conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf  
COPY ${APACHE_CONFIG}/extra/vhosts.conf ./conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf  
  
ARG APACHE_PUBLIC_HTML  
ARG VIRTUAL_HOST  
ARG APACHE_LOGS  
  
## Serve Public Files to Container  
COPY ${APACHE_PUBLIC_HTML} ./htdocs/${VIRTUAL_HOST}/public_html  
  
## Document Volumes  
VOLUME ["/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/${VIRTUAL_HOST}/public_html"]  
VOLUME ["/usr/local/apache2/logs"]  
  
## Document Exposed Priveleged Port  
EXPOSE 443  
  
## Set Working Directory  
WORKDIR /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/${VIRTUAL_HOST}/public_html  
  
# Start Server in Foreground  
CMD ["httpd", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]  
```
