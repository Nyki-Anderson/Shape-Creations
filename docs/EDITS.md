# EDITS  
  
## Tuesday, 07-11-2023  
  
- 20:41: Updated the date format for all files to `dddd, MM-DD-YYYY HH:mm`.  
- 20:31: Added a Module Objectives section to the first lesson in every module as well as Lesson Objectives on each other lesson. Also added an Overview header at the top and a Wrapping Up header to summarize at the bottom of each Lesson. These headers will help maintain some consistency and better map our knowledge.  
- 20:31: Added emojis to each header that is related to the topic (tried to anyway) so that the lessons become more visual.  
  
## Monday, 07-10-2023  
  
- 15:01: Refactored tags by removing redundancy and reducing outliers.  
- 15:01: Added an emoji to every header in the tutorial series as well as formatted tutorial templates to include the headers Overview, Wrapping Up, and References (rather than Footnotes).  
- 15:01: Introduced `See Also` convention and made new links between notes.  
- 15:01: Switched from Footnote to References and properly cited all links in Tutorial. In text citations still use the Footnote notation but instead of links, they refer to APA7 styled citations.  
- 15:01: Refactored the `0.1-Dockerizing` folder by adding a separate section for [Design Principles](0.1-Design-Principles.md#) rather than having this topic covered in section `0.0-The-Stack`
