## 🎯 Lesson Objectives  
  
> **By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:**  
> - List the four Docker services we will need to configure for Shape Creations.  
> - Describe the role of each service in the greater Shape Creations project.  
> - Understand the cyclical nature of this phase and why we can’t do everything one at a time.  
> - Visualize the directory file tree we will end up with by the end of the Docker phase.  
> - Describe what each folder in the directory tree will contain.  
> - List the design principles that guide decision-making throughout the Docker phase and project at large.  
> - Understand how to start a project as a workspace in VS Code.  
  
## ⛰ Overview  
  
For Shape Creations, we will use Docker to run four separate services or containers: namely, (1) Apache, (2) PHP, (3) MariaDB, and (4) PHPMyAdmin. Each of these will be isolated Docker services that communicate through a shared network. We will get into this dynamic more later, but we will also be utilizing Dockerfiles and Docker Compose to orchestrate all of these services. The rest of this lesson will be a bird’s eye view of Shape Creations itself including: a description of each of the services’ duties, the workflow, a directory tree, and a discussion on design principles.  
  
## 🐕‍🦺 The Stack: Services We Will Need  
  
1) [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) is an open source web server project that has been around forever. Most tutorials I found when starting this project were centered around Nginx, another web server service. I am very comfortable with Apache and find its configuration to be more extensible and customizable. We will be configuring our Apache server to use HTTPS using SSL certificate verification and a virtual host, as well as serve PHP scripts.  
  
2) [PHP](https://www.php.net/) is a web-development programming language. Specifically, we will be using [PHP-FPM](https://www.php.net/) which is especially built for handling multiple tasks quickly using a concept called pools. It will be our logic-handler. Most of the project will be scripted using PHP (and of course HTML/CSS to flesh out the site itself).  
  
3) [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/) is an open source relational, SQL-based database infrastructure, with a focus on security and scalability. It uses a similar query syntax to MySQL, though we will require little knowledge of this language thanks to PHPMyAdmin.  
  
4) [PHPMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) is a web-based GUI for managing MySQL and MariaDB databases. It will not be a “permanent” service, as we will only run the container as needed to create and design our database structure.  
  
## 💼 Docker Workflow  
  
Now that we’re starting the Shape Creations project, we have a massive task ahead of us. We will break it up into many smaller pieces in each module and lesson. Following along now will be important as many of the steps unfold in parallel.  
  
> 🌎 The Big Picture    
> I will attempt to simplify this project by showing “complete” code ahead of showing the steps that lead up to it. Look for these big picture admonitions throughout.  
  
We will start by building out a `Dockerfile` for each image. Then, we will use Docker Compose to configure and run containers built from those images. Each container will need to *communicate* with the others (preferably only the services that need to talk to each other will be connected for security purposes) though each service will be standalone.  
  
> 🔒 Security    
>This is an industry standard in place to reduce the impact of a breach into any one service. The other services will be protected and there will be less an attacker can access.  
  
> 🔮 Crystal Ball    
> Once our Docker services all have running containers that communicate between each other, we will begin the build out of the actual site itself. More on that in Module 3.  
  
## 🌲 Directory Tree  
  
This is the directory tree for *just the Docker Phase* of Shape Creations. If it seems a little overwhelming right now, don’t worry, we will build this out piece by piece throughout the Module 1 lessons. I wanted you to be able to visualize how we will be structuring the folders and especially where to keep the source code for the project (`src/`).  
  
Some *Docker-specific* files will remain outside of the main `.docker/` folder and this is by design. Many Docker Compose directives use relative paths and automatically detect files like `.env` and `.dockerignore` if they are within the same directory.

## 🏗 Design Principles  
  
An important aspect of project design is establishing guiding principles that help make important decisions along the way. I found this out during the Docker Phase of the project, as I started out without any.... The design principles I will enumerate here came to be through trial and error, but once established, helped me throughout the rest of the project.  
  
> 🌎 The Big Picture    
> We will often refer back to these design principles in later modules and phases of the project. I may also establish module-specific principles but those will generally be in addition to those listed here.  
  
### 💡 DevSecOps  
  
DevSecOps stands for **Dev**elopment, **Sec**urity, and **Op**erations and describes the mantra that cyclically includes security throughout the development process.[^1] This means keeping security engrained in the code from project inception to end of life. Too often, security is an afterthought when it deeply impacts all stakeholders of a project.  
  
> 🪟 See Also    
> DevSecOps is a fascinating culture blossoming in today’s tech industry. I would implore you to read more about it from [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-guideline/), a leading authority on software security. Or do a simple Google search for even more industry-specific information.  
  
### 💡 Rule of Least Privilege  
  
Probably the most important design principle models the rule of least privilege. The rule of least privilege states that processes should be run using the lowest level of privilege possible.[^2] Specialized users and groups should be favored over `root`. Consider using a different user for each task and creating a group to encompass all low-level users. In this way, we protect ourselves during unauthorized access attacks because that attacker will be limited to whatever that specific user can do.  
  
### 💡 Think Modular  
  
Wherever possible, design code to be generalized and scalable. Favor classes and templates over specialized and task-specific. When we design things to be modular, it not only improves organization but reduces work considerably down the road.  
  
### 💡 Less is More  
  
Only include what is necessary for the service or process to operate. Do not install unnecessary programs or tools with the hope to configure them at some other date; just install at a later date. Bloating your code reduces speed and efficiency and may open your code up to unforeseen attacks.  
  
### 💡 Remember the Environment  
  
Design for development and production simultaneously, or at least provide a mechanism to quickly swap in an environment when need be. When we do this, we make conscious choices in the beginning of development that help us think in terms of eventual production differences. Some differences between development and production are: users, passwords, logging level, error reporting, etc. Keep definitions of these variables in something like a dedicated `production.env` file, and other generalized variables in the original `.env` file.  
  
### 💡 Variables over Hardcoding  
  
Things change; we make decisions and refactor our code often. Why not make those changes in one place that affect all the other instances of it? A `.env` file is a great example of this. We should not hardcode common paths either in case we refactor the directory structure or move files. This principle goes hand in hand with [Remember the Environment](0.0-Module-Overview.md#remember-the-environment) as we can circumvent making massive changes to the code before production by using variables in an `.env` file.  
  
## VS Code Workspaces  
  
[VS Code Workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces) are a folder or collection of folders that open in a window or instance of VS Code. We will be setting up ShapeCreations in such a workspace. To get started, in `Finder` create a new folder somewhere in your directory. I keep all of my VS Code workspaces in a dedicated `VS_Code` folder.; so my path would be `~/VS_Code/ShapeCreations`.  
  
Now open VS Code and in the `File` menu, `Add Folder to Workspace...` . Choose the folder you just created. This will open a new instance of VS Code with your folder as root `.`.  
  
![add-folder-workspace.png](../media/add-folder-workspace.png#)  
  
Once you have opened the folder. You will want to create a workspace, which will essentially become a *multi-root* workspace with your project as its name. To do this, again, go to the `File` menu and select `Save Workspace As...`.  
  
![save-workspace-as.png](../media/save-workspace-as.png#)    
Here, you will create a `.code-workspace` file which will hold all your settings. You can even create more descriptive paths for your folders within the workspace. I do this for my other VS Code workspaces but not this one.  
  
![save-workspace.png](../media/save-workspace.png#)  
  
Now that you have created a workspace, we can start customizing it immediately. I haven’t done much in this workspace myself but I do like the [Peacock Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.vscode-peacock) to create a random color for the borders of the workspace. This is so I can tell which workspace I’m working in as I have many.  
  
## 🎁 Wrapping Up  
  
This was a short section just to set a course for where we’re going with the Docker Phase of Shape Creations. We will refer back to this overview throughout the project, especially as we use the design principles in our code. Now that we have a VS Code workspace, all that’s left is to dive right into how we can use Docker to run a full stack web application.
