## The Docker Stack  
  
For Shape Creations, we will use Docker to run four separate services or containers: namely, (1) Apache, (2) PHP, (3) MariaDB, and (4) PHPMyAdmin. Each of these will be isolated Docker services that communicate through a shared network. We will get into this dynamic more later, but we will also be utilizing Dockerfiles and Docker Compose to orchestrate all of these services. Instead of a separate module or section introducing these topics, we will actively learn them as we go.  
  
The rest of this module will contain a section for the initial configuration of each of the four Docker services. We will harden each service in the next module but security will be a key focus throughout the project; returning to our images and containers as needed.  
  
### Services We Need  
  
1. [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) is an open source web server project that has been around forever. Most tutorials I found when starting this project were centered around Nginx, another web server service. I am very comfortable with Apache and find its configuration to be more extensible and customizable. We will be configuring our Apache server to use HTTPS using SSL certificate verification and a virtual host, as well as serve PHP scripts.  
2. [PHP](https://www.php.net/) is a web-development programming language. Specifically, we will be using [PHP-FPM](https://www.php.net/) which is especially built for handling multiple tasks using quickly using a concept called pools. It will be our logic-handler. Most of the project will be scripted using PHP (though of course HTML and CSS) will be used to flesh out the site itself.  
3. [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/) is an open source relational, SQL-based database infrastructure, with a focus on security and scalability. It uses a similar query syntax to MySQL, though we will require little knowledge of this language thanks to PHPMyAdmin.  
4. [PHPMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) is a web-based GUI for managing MySQL and MariaDB databases. It will not be a “permanent” service, as we will only run the container as needed to create and design our database structure.  
  
## Docker Workflow  
  
Now that we’re starting the Shape Creations project, we have a massive task ahead of us. We will break it up into many smaller pieces in each module and section. Following along now will be important as many of the steps unfold in parallel.  
  
> 🌎 The Big Picture    
> I will attempt to simplify this project by showing “complete” code ahead of showing the steps that lead up to it. Look for these big picture admonitions throughout.  
  
We will start by building out a `Dockerfile` for each image. Then, we will use Docker Compose to configure and run containers built from those images. Each container will need to “communicate” with the others (preferably only the services that need to talk to each other will be connected for security purposes) though each service will be standalone.  
  
> 🔒 Security    
>This is an industry standard in place to reduce the impact of a breach into any one service. The other services will be protected and there will be less an attacker can access.  
  
> 🔮 Crystal Ball    
> Once our Docker services all have running containers that communicate between each other, we will begin the build out of the actual site itself. More on that in Module 3.  
  
## Docker File Tree  
  
Make a folder called `ShapeCreations` (or whatever your project name is) and make the following directory structure: a folder name `.config` and another folder named `.dockerfiles`. You may also wish to make the nested folders as seen in the directory tree below.  
  
> ✏ Note    
> The `.` in front of the folder names causes them to be “hidden” directories which really only helps us keep them at the top of the directory structure.

```  
  
> 🔮 Crystal Ball    
> This was a short section just to set a course for where we’re going. We will start right in with the the initial Dockerfile image configurations in the [0.2-Apache-Image](./0.2-Apache-Image.md#) section.
