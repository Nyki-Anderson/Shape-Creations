## ⛰ Overview  
  
## 🏃‍♀ Hitting the Ground Running  
  
So there are still a lot of Docker that we have yet to see. In this module, we will learn about Dockerfiles as we design our Apache image. This will be the longest section of the Dockerfile Module mainly because we will have to learn how to setup a `dockerfile` in the first place. So without further ado, let’s start running!  
  
## 🪶 Our Apache Image  
  
> 🌎 The Big Picture    
> Before we get started, here’s what our complete Apache `apache.dockerfile` will look like and it should be included in the `.dockerfiles` folder. This is the state of the `apache.dockerfile` as it is at the end of this Module. The full Dockerfile, if amended, is of course available at `.dockerfiles/apache.dockerfile` in the main project directory.
