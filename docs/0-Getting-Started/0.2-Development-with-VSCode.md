## Visual Studio Code  
  
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode) is just as impressive as Obsidian. Similarly the “Extension” building community is highly active and it is capable of being your one stop shop for all your hard-skill programming needs. VSCode can compile, run, debug, automate (and so much more) nearly any programming language. You can even use Markdown Language and push `.md` files to Github without needing Obsidian at all but I realized that for project management I require some bells and whistles that I don’t find easily in VSCode  
  
> 🔦 Flashback    
> Although it is certainly not your next IDE (Integrated Development Environment), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) has a plugin called [Execute Code](https://github.com/twibiral/obsidian-execute-code) that allows you to run code within a note! This is great for quick examples and comes in handy when you don’t want to create a new project in your IDE for a couple lines of code.  
  
VSCode is the most robust IDE on the market and it is now available to download for any operating system. Plus, you can define multiple scopes or workspaces to specialize an environment for each language or project with which you work. Let’s get started by installing it.  
  
### Installing VS Code  
  
As mentioned, VSCode is available for download on any OS. To do so just go to this page [VSCode Installation Overview ](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the instructions. After doing so, the real fun begins; customizing your user and workspace settings.  
  
### Customizing VS Code  
  
> 🌎 Big Picture    
>It is important to remember with all these tools that they were meant to be extremely customizable. Half of the fun of choosing your tools is making them work for you. A well configured tool can make your life and the life of your project immeasurably easier. Consider spending some time on this step. It will pay off in the end!  
  
My preferred configuration starts with creating a new folder in my `~/VSCode_Projects` in this case I’ve named the folder `ShapeCreations` from MacOS’s *Finder* app. Then from inside VSCode I go up to `File > Save Workspace As...` and keep the default name for the **multi-root workspace** file `ShapeCreations.code-workspace`. This file will eventually flesh out the project’s (or workspace ) settings. This file will be fairly bland at first, but as you add extensions and start to identify what is necessitated by the project, it will start to populate naturally.  
  
> 🍎 Definition    
> **Multi-root Workspace** : A VSCode environment that encompasses the root project folder and all subdirectories, and contains a `*.code-workspace` file. Within this environment, settings can be prioritized and specified based on the language/s used within the project or just configured for usability. Anything that would normally go in the `settings.json` will go in this file for the workspace. I won’t go into much detail here as I’m most excited to share the extensions but VSCode goes into great detail about settings for each scope (user, workspace, global, etc). You can find that information here : [Multi-root Workspaces in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces).  
  
### The Extensions Marketplace  
  
I will try to be project focused here, as there are so many directions to go with extensions. The [VSCode extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace) building community is very active. Which extensions you choose to install will depend on the languages you are working with, the level of auto=completion desired, the level of linting desired, UI theme and customization taste, etc.  
  
> ✏ Note    
> VSCode can detect and recommend extensions based on your source code and will usually apply the correct extensions to that code regardless of how granular you are with configuration.  
  
Let’s get into it, shall we?  
  
### Installing, Enabling, and Configuring Extensions  
  
Installing extensions is as easy as opening up the extensions viewer on the far left menu, searching the marketplace (based on a language or need such as `php` or `linter`), clicking install/enable, and then configuring as needed. You can find the configuration settings for each  
  
> 🌎 Big Picture    
> Starting out installing extensions may get overwhelming. I’ve spent countless hours in the [Extensions Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode). If you have the tendency (like me) to install everything that sounds remotely useful and then forget about 90% of it, ask yourself, do I need it *right now*. This next section will only go over extensions used in this project but I will list my full list of extensions at the end for your review.  
  
There are several *classes* of extension that I can define: built-in language interpreters and compilers, [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) language detection and auto-completion, linters (prettier, black, etc), external application integrations (Docker and Git integration), UI customizations (themes, icons, etc.), and miscellaneous improvements (project management, environment organization, etc.).  
  
#### Built-in Language Interpreters & Compilers  
  
These are not extensions per se, but are built in language recognition features of VSCode. They can be disabled but not uninstalled. These are your essentials; providing syntax highlighting and such. There are dozens more than this list, these are just the ones related to this project.  
  
- CSS Language Basics  
- Docker Language Basics  
- HTML Language Basics  
- Ini Language Basics  
- Javascript Language Basics  
- JSON Language Basics  
- Make Language Basics  
- Markdown Language Basics  
- PHP Language Basics  
- SQL Language Basics  
- YML Language Basics  
  
#### Intellisense  
  
Nearly every programming language has an [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) component. These are your smart code completions and snippet generating extensions. They make coding in new and familiar languages a breeze because you can get a sense of whether you’re typing out the correct line or command.  
  
- [Apache conf syntax highlighting for VS Code.](https://github.com/mrmlnc/vscode-apache)  
- [Makefile Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.makefile-tools)  
- [PHP Intellephense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client)  
  
#### Linters  
  
Linters are great because they maintain rules for the structure of your code. They also helps you conform to (more or less) standardized code organization conventions. It helps you indent correctly, place your squiggly brackets, and overall maintain the readability of your code. Smart code spell-checking has been a game changer for my comments.  
  
- [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)  
- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)  
- [Format HTML in PHP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rifi2k.format-html-in-php)  
- [Sort JSON Objects](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=richie5um2.vscode-sort-json)  
- [Spell Check](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=timonwong.shellcheck)  
  
#### External Application Integrations  
  
Though I make use of more of these external integrations in other projects, these are the few I use in this project. The Docker integration is actually quite powerful as you can investigate the contents of a running container from within the UI. And of course XDebug is essential for PHP debugging.  
  
- [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)  
- [PHP XDebug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xdebug.php-debug)  
  
#### UI Customization  
  
There are so many themes and icon packs to choose from. As of this moment, my laptop screen has... issues... *sigh*. So I’ve had to switch everything over to light theme. But what I like about the GitHub theme is that it is clear and easy on the eyes. Peacock is also a nifty tool I use to randomly select a color for the UI outline; helping to differentiate between projects. Icon packs not only spritz up your folder icons but help to navigate the source code visually.  
  
- [GitHub Light High Contrast](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=guilhermestella.github-light-hight-contrast-theme)  
- [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)  
- [Peacock](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.vscode-peacock)  
  
#### Miscellaneous Improvements  
  
Live preview is again, a tool for markdown that helps me to visualize exactly how it will render in the Github repository. I use Obsidian for most of my markdown adventures but when I use VSCode it is almost preferable... almost. Project manager helps easily switch between different workspaces or environments. And I can’t live without another typewriter auto-scroll (which I use in Obsidian if you recall).  
  
- [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server)  
- [Markdown Preview Github Style](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles)  
- [Project Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.project-manager)  
- [Typewriter Auto-Scroll](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MikeyLau.typewriter-auto-scroll)

### Wrapping-Up  
  
As you can see, VSCode is more than a powerful IDE, it’s a project manager. With the wealth of extensions available from the marketplace, you can be sure that you are writing your best code. There’s so much more to discover and I may come back to this part of the tutorial as I learn more. The main takeaway should be that you have an endlessly customizable working environment now, so go make it your own!  
  
> 🔮 Crystal Ball    
>Now that we are familiar with VSCode, we can move onto the more granular topic of getting familiar with our tools and their commands. The next section is very important! Don’t skip it if you can manage. We will be going over the nuances of Docker and its gang of commands. I could not get a foothold in this project before I took this Udemy course on Docker: [Docker & Kubernetes: The Practical Guide, 2023 Edition](https://www.udemy.com/share/103Ia0/).
