## ‚õ∞ Overview  
  
The next two sections will detail my programming and project environment for anyone interested and will of course be entirely subjective. I am pretty proud of my go to tools but they are by no means the only way to implement this project. Skip ahead to the [Section 0.3 Docker Primer](./0.3-Docker-Primer.md#) document if you are ready, otherwise let‚Äôs talk about tools and apps that make coding and taking research notes more enjoyable and productive.  
  
> ‚úè Note:    
> I am not compensated in anyway by the products or companies I am about to shower with praise. I just get really passionate about my tools.  
  
## üìì Note-Taking and Project Management  
  
### ‚ö´ Obsidian  
  
While effectively not doing my homework one day, I stumbled upon, what is now one of my favorite productivity apps, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).At it‚Äôs heart it is a note-taking app typed completely in it‚Äôs own flavor of **Markdown Language** and stored locally on your host machine.  
  
> üçé Definition    
> **Markdown Language** : Is a pseudo-language that is written completely in plain text, using symbols and quick (hot) keys to format and otherwise customize the appearance of the text, rather than using menus like a traditional word processor. Among the many options: you can bold, italicize, create links, assign different sized headers, etc. all without taking your hands off the keyboard.  
  
Why is this awesome? First of all, Markdown makes styling and formatting your work quicker than clicking a menu button every time you want something bold or linked. Also if you‚Äôre developing anything proprietary or private, not having it floating in the cloud somewhere is one less thing to worry about. But, I think its true claim to fame is the active community of plugin developers that overwhelm the app with functionality. Another unique feature of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is its adoption of the **Zettelkasten** method of ‚Äúnote linking.‚Äù  
  
> üçé Definition    
> **Zettelkasten** : Is a method of linking concepts and notes to related concepts and notes through the use of tags, headers, or other user-defined metadata. In practice, it is proven to reinforce learning, define hidden connections between concepts, and organize large bodies of information.  
  
> üîÆ Crystal Ball    
> If Obsidian doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs for you, skip ahead to my next project management pick, [0.2-Development-with-VSCode](./0.2-Development-with-VSCode.md#). Although, I do advocate that you choose a similar application to keep track of your progress though this tutorial and seek other resources to supplement.  
>  
> It is to your benefit to keep track of your resources (even just using footnotes), where you borrowed a script from, or read about something you‚Äôll want to remember but soon forget. If you‚Äôre lucky, this project will teach you something you need in the future and it would be very nifty to just return to your notes with all the information intact.

#### üß∞ Installing Obsidian  
  
Follow this link, [Download and install Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian), and choose the download for your OS. Follow the installer instructions. Once you have correctly installed the application, open it and you will be greeted by a window called the **Vault Switcher**. Obsidian which asks you to either ‚ÄúCreate new vault‚Äù or ‚ÄúOpen folder as vault.‚Äù  
  
> üçé Definition    
> **Vault & Vault Switcher** : As mentioned previously, Obsidianstores your files on your local file system as opposed to a cloud-based system. The folder in which you store the `.md` files generated by the app is called your ‚ÄúVault‚Äù and the only thing that distinguishes it from your other folders is the `.obsidian` folder, which contains all the configuration for the app. Should you decide to make more than one Vault, you can copy that folder and paste it into your other vaults, otherwise you will need to reconfigure each Vault from scratch.  
  
If you‚Äôre completely new to Markdown Language, peruse the [Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Home) wiki which will walk you through the basic to advanced features available natively (without installing community plugins). There are a few core plugins that are native as well that you can explore. When you are comfortable navigating your Vault and formatting your notes, you may wish to take things to the next level!  
  
You will find a tab called ‚ÄúCommunity Plugins‚Äù on the left hand menu within the app settings window.  
  
#### üß∞ Installing Community Plugins  
  
> ‚ö† Warning!    
> Installing community plugins requires that you disable a feature called ‚ÄúRestricted Mode.‚Äù Community plugins go through a vetting process in order to be offered on the [Obsidian Plugins](https://obsidian.md/plugins#) marketplace, the process is by no means perfect and there is still a chance that malicious code could be injected into a plugin you install.  
>  
> Always verify plugins by reviewing their code on Github. Another good test is how many people have installed the app before you, which can be found in just below the plugin‚Äôs title. Once disabled, you may review and search for community plugins by going to ‚Äúbrowse.‚Äù  
  
There is a steep learning curve at first but once you have customized a few hot key shortcuts and installed a few community plugins, it‚Äôs crazy how productive and organized you can become. It is definitely something that will become more yours over time, especially when it comes to adding new plugins to your workflow. I like to deep dive every few months into the plugin underbelly to see what‚Äôs new. Each time I do this, I refine my ‚ÄúVaults‚Äù even more. I will list and share my current configuration with a few honorable mentions as well as provide an exhaustive list of all the plugins I currently use.  
  
#### üÜï Community Plugins: Must-Haves  
  
- [Admonitions: Adds admonition block-styled content](https://github.com/javalent/admonitions) This is one of my favorite features of in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) because it styles your callouts to better stand out from the rest of the text. With several presets and the option for custom designs, Admonition is great for definitions, example problems, equations, tips, and more. It‚Äôs a nice visual way to give your notes some differentiation instead of never-ending paragraphs or bullet points.  
- [Codemirror Options: Obsidian plugin with options to customize the behavior of CodeMirror](<https://github.com/nothingislost/obsidian-codemirror-options)> As a programmer, this plugin is a necessity. It provides syntax highlighting for code blocks and so much more! Great for those taking computer science courses, or doing research, or learning a new language.  
- [Dataview: A high-performance data index and query language over Markdown files.](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) While I‚Äôm still working on my familiarity with Dataview‚Äôs API, I have been able to find a couple of awesome uses for it. Treat your Vault like a database and query using any metadata field and value. This is great for compiling a table of books you haven‚Äôt quite finished yet or studying for a midterm. Metadata, you will find, is one of the most versatile features in the entire app and the sooner you implement it the sooner you can start manipulating it.  
- [Folder Note: Plugin to add description note to a folder for Obsidian.](https://github.com/xpgo/obsidian-folder-note-plugin) I started using Folder Notes pretty recently but am in love with the ability to add a [Waypoint](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint) to this file for a full directory tree of the given folder. You can create a basic dashboard for each folder and then link them to your main dashboard using the [Homepage](https://github.com/mirnovov/obsidian-homepage) plugin.  
- [Homepage: An Obsidian plugin that opens a specified note, canvas, or workspace on startup, instead of the most recent one.](https://github.com/mirnovov/obsidian-homepage) Once I started making dashboards, this was app that brought it all together. There are many dashboard templates out there and once you‚Äôve settled on one, use the Homepage plugin to have it always pinned and open.  
- [Kanban: Create markdown-backed Kanban boards in Obsidian.](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) I like this plugin because you can keep track of different features of your want to implement in your project and move ‚Äúcards‚Äù into different lists depending on their status. I start with jotting down future ideas, then move the cards to the in-progress list while I‚Äôm working on it, and finally move the cards to the complete list for a visual method of productivity.  
- [Linter: An Obsidian plugin that formats and styles your notes with a focus on configurability and extensibility.](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter) Linter keeps the formatting rules consistent throughout your entire vault. Set it to lint on save and watch as your extra spaces, missing bullet points, and accidental lowercase title are corrected. This plugin makes for peace of mind if you are OCD like me. There are dozens of configurations to fine-tune but once you lockdown a personal style, you‚Äôll never be want to type without Linter again.  
- [Metadata Menu](https://mdelobelle.github.io/metadatamenu/) This is one of my new obsessions because it makes your metadata smarter. You can set each field to accept certain values like boolean, date, file link, or select one from a list of possible values. This plugin is your metadata magic wand, preserving its integrity on every note. You can also configure ‚ÄúFile Classes‚Äù or types of notes and define the list of metadata fields those kinds of notes can accept. It has a nice graphical configuration option and works great with the Templater plugin to standardize common file types.  
- [Periodic Notes: Create/manage your daily, weekly, and monthly notes in Obsidian](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) I use this app to stay organized in my personal vault. It automatically generates a daily note from a template you create when clicking on the calendar plugin. You can also create templates for weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly journals that compile the entries from the daily notes to keep track of goals, appointments, and random musings. Once you get the template buttoned down, there‚Äôs no limit to what positive habits you can maintain.  
- [Supercharged links: obsidian plugin to add attributes and context menu options to internal links](https://github.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links) I‚Äôm still discovering the magic of Supercharged links. For now I simply use it to track the status of the notes in my projects; I configured notes to change colors based on whether or not I‚Äôve started working on it, finished it, or not started yet. But there is so much more you can do including add emojis and other formatting to links so that they are easily recognizable at a glance. Not to mention they can be queried with Dataview.  
- [Tasks: Task management for the Obsidian knowledge base.](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) Tasks is immensely useful when you create to do lists with deadlines or if you just like to keep track of when you complete them. Using emojis and timestamps, this plugin allows you to transform your checklists into smart lists. Similar to Dataview (though considerably more light weight) you can query tasks with like attributes such as ‚Äúundone‚Äù or ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù so you never lose a task in your notes again.  
- [Templater: A template plugin for obsidian](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) : As the tagline states, this is a plugin for making note templates. The convenience factor here is powerful. With a little work in the beginning, you can create auto-populating content for as many file types as you need. On top of that, you can configure several different ways to generate new notes: connecting a note type to a specific folder, setting hot keys, selecting a default note type, and going through the Command Palette. I think this is a must have plugin, I have templates for general metadata, notes, research, recipes, daily journal, and this tutorial. It‚Äôs also great for pre-populating your YAML section with metadata fields and can even be configured to prompt you for input at note creation. It has its own API to gather system info like the title of the note or creation/modification dates and time.

> üåé Big Picture    
> As you can see, Obsidian has a rich community of plugin developers. It is easy to be too ambitious in the beginning. I really only used a couple of plugins on a regular basis for a while; some in my list are still slated for future use. The plugin I most wish to learn is [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) because it is so expansive and allows you to manipulate your Vaults as if they were databases. Plus many other plugins use Dataview for more complex applications.  
>  
> It is perhaps good practice to dedicate yourself to a few absolutely necessary plugins to get started and focus on familiarizing yourself with Markdown and determine your metadata schema early on. I wish I had seen the importance of metadata earlier. Also, regularly comb through your plugins list to prune any that didn‚Äôt work the way you had wished and/or never use.  
>  
> The list of plugins I provided was compiled from all of my Vaults and are not necessarily applicable to some of them. For instance my school Vaults do not need the [Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) plugin but I use it everyday in my personal Vault. Half the fun is learning how to use the plugins so don‚Äôt get overwhelmed. Stick with it and soon you may even wish to code your own plugin.

##### üèÅ Obsidian: Themes  
  
Beyond plugins, the theme building community is mature as well. I seem to change out my theme once every couple months, but not all themes are created equally. I think the best one of I‚Äôve tried is [Minimal: A distraction-free and highly customizable theme for Obsidian](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) which when paired with the accompanying plugin [Minimal Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings) has the whole package.  
  
> ‚úè Note    
> For the Vault I create these tutorials in though, I opted for a Github flavored theme called [Theme-Github](https://github.com/krios2146/obsidian-theme-github) in order to get a better idea how it will render once pushed to Github.  
  
Most themes have light and dark mode options and some can even be granularly customized using the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin. And if you‚Äôre up for it, you can even design your own theme or just a ‚ÄúSnippet, ‚Äùsince Obsidian themes are written in CSS.  
  
## üéÅ Wrapping Up  
  
While rather off-topic, I think it is important to share the tools and tricks that work for you with others. I hope you were at least inspired to take note-taking seriously enough to implement your own conventions and seek your own solutions.  
  
As mentioned, there is a steep learning-curve when getting started with Obsidian, especially if you are not familiar with Markdown code. Getting your hands right in there and playing with the different plugins is the best way to become a note-taking pro.  
  
The hotkeys and formatting shortcuts will make your notes more consistent and even improve the speed at which you are able to organize content meaningfully. At the time of writing this lesson, I have been using Obsidian for a year and I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd be without it for school and in personal projects such as this.  
  
> üîÆ Crystal Ball    
> The [next lesson](0.1-Note-Taking-with-Obsidian.md#) will be subjective as well because we will be doing deep dive on another tool in my tool belt called Visual Studio Code (VS Code).  
  
While Obsidian is completely optional, this project will be very difficult if you do not use VS Code. If you haven‚Äôt already embraced it, I suggest you take the leap. I‚Äôm certain you will thank me later. Now, let‚Äôs move on.
