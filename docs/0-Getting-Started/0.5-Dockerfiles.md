## Dockerfile Syntax  
  
> 🍎 Definition    
> A Dockerfile is a text file that contains all the commands and information necessary to build an image.  
  
Within a Dockerfile, there are several instruction types that can be used to do anything from run CLI programs, install programs, switch users, copy files from the host to the image, set the runtime command, and more! Before we take a look at our first Dockerfile, we must go through definition hell for each instruction type and explore some best use practices.  
  
> ✏ Note    
> We will only cover the basic usages of these commands, for a complete reference, check out the [Docker - Dockerfile Reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).  
  
### General Rules  
  
Docker syntax is quite simple at its core. Comments are denoted with a `#` symbol and each command must be on its own line. While not required, all instructions are typically written using ALL CAPS.  
  
```Dockerfile  
# This is a comment  
FROM apache  
```  
  
Since we are writing the instructions to build a nicely packaged Docker image. Each new instruction denotes another layer in the image and will build in order.  
  
> 🔮 Crystal Ball    
> There are some exceptions to this new layer rule that I will point out when we get there.  
  
There are some considerations to be had when deciding when and where we put certain instructions. This is because when we build our images, a cache helps keep track of what has changed from the present build to the previous, then only building layers that have changed starting from the first change.  
  
In practice, this means putting instructions that copy code subject to change near the end and simple installations near the beginning so that we don’t have to rebuild installation layers each time a configuration file is changed.  
  
> 🔒 Security    
> Remember, each layer in an image can be inspected with a simple command! Our layers should not contain any secrets or otherwise sensitive information. We will discuss how to get around this soon.  
  
#### Naming the File  
  
Dockerfiles are usually named `dockerfile` (or some version of that). This helps, especially for VS Code to help auto suggestions. We will be using the `{service_name}.dockerfile` convention in our project as VS Code recognizes it.  
  
> 🔮 Crystal Ball    
 > We want VS Code to recognize these files because it will help us select valid base image variants and versions as well as help with syntax.  
  
#### The `FROM` Instruction  
  
Every Dockerfile needs a `FROM...` instruction at the beginning of the file. This is like the `docker pull` command on the CLI. In general, you can use any base image from the Docker Hub, but there are often variants and specific versions that can be specified.  
  
> ✏ Note    
> It is good practice to specify both of these things in our Dockerfiles as it will protect us from unforeseen differences between versions that can break our builds.  
  
Dockerfiles can be as simple as a `FROM` instruction but if this is all you need, you may as well build your image from the CLI. Nothing can precede a `FROM` instruction except comments or `ARG` instructions.  
  
#### Variable Replacement: The `ENV` & `ARG` Instructions  
  
So I mentioned before that there are some exceptions to the layer per instruction rule. Two of those exceptions are the `ARG` and `ENV` instructions. These instructions are used to pass variables into our image build. We will discuss each individually as they should be used for two distinct purposes. Their shared purpose though is to prevent having to hardcode values that might otherwise be different for different image builds (e.g., development vs. production).  
  
##### `ENV`  
  
The `ENV` instruction is used to replace values both during the image build and during container runtime. This means, `ENV` values can be accessed by the containers after an image is built using the Dockerfile.  
  
There are a number of ways we can set `ENV` variables. There is an order of precedence too that allows certain methods to override others.[^1] That order goes as follows (highest to lowest):  
  
1. Using the `-e` flag in a `docker compose -e` in the CLI.  
2. Substituted from your shell variables.  
3. Set using the `environment` attribute in the `docker-compose.yml` file.  
4. Defining `ENV` variables in the Dockerfile itself by hardcoding values.  
  
The `ENV` key is often named using ALL CAPS and the syntax for `ENV` variables is as such:  
  
```Dockerfile  
ENV KEY=value  
  
RUN some_command ${KEY}  
```  
  
Once set in the Dockerfile, `ENV` values cannot be overridden from the command line at build time. They can however be changed after container runtime which can be useful if you wish to have a different value parsed in the container than what was used in the image itself. A common use for this is when you want to run different containers using the same image.  
  
You would very generally use `ENV` variables to pass credentials, certificates, secrets, and other sensitive information to the containers that require them.  
  
> 🔒 Security    
> We will not use `ENV` variables *directly* to send sensitive information to our containers. Instead, we will use a neat service provided by Docker called [Docker Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/) (more on this later).  
  
##### `ARG`  
  
The `ARG` instruction is used to pass variables at build time, which means they are only available within the scope of the image, not the container. This can be useful when you want to pass a value to the image but not have it accessible to the container once running. The syntax for `ARG` instructions is identical to that of `ENV` instructions:  
  
```Dockerfile  
ARG KEY=value  
  
RUN some_command ${KEY}  
```  
  
> 🔒 Security    
> `ARG` instructions are *not* a good way to pass secrets, credentials, or other sensitive material to the image! Values passed this are visible to any user with the `docker history` command.[^2]  
  
> 🔦 Flashback    
> As mentioned in the `FROM` instruction heading, the `ARG` instruction is the only instruction that can precede it and the `ARG` itself must only be referenced in that `FROM` instruction, as for, the variant or version number. For example:  
>  
> ```Dockerfile  
> ARG VERSION=2.4.57  
> FROM httpd:${VERSION}  
> ```  
>  
> However, any `ARG` variables set above the `FROM` instruction must be re-declared below it to be made usable to the rest of the build.  
  
Something unique to `ARG` variables is that they can be set from the CLI using `--build-arg {ARGUMENT_VARIABLE}`. `ENV` variables cannot be dynamically changed in this way.  
  
Common use cases for `ARG` variables are version numbers and tags for the base image and when setting a non-root user. We have also elected to use them to simplify host path names that are subject to change as our project directory evolves.  
  
> 🔮 Crystal Ball    
> In a rather unconventional way, we will be using a universal `.env` file to set our `ARG` variables using Docker Compose. This is not necessarily how our final project will handle `ARG` variables but it works and prevents the need to hardcode repetitive values into each Dockerfile. Security considerations on this are inconclusive at the time this Module has been written...
