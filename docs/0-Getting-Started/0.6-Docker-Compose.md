# 0.6-Docker-Compose  
  
---  
  
## Overview  
  
We will be implementing each of the services listed earlier in order as much as possible though a lot of the process is intertwined.  
  
> ✏ Note    
> We will need some services to check if others are working. So we will do a lot of ground work, then fine tune.  
  
This will be made very easy using something called a `docker-compose.yml` file which will orchestrate all of the services without needing long, drawn out command line entries. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is now an extension of Docker itself and has its own syntax. You can get help for any `docker compose` commands using the `--help` flag just as with any other Docker command.  
  
```shell  
$ docker compose --help  
```  
  
While Docker Compose relieves us of the need to use Docker fully in the command line, I will attempt to show the equivalent commands to give us some perspective on how helpful the tool really is. In the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/103Ia0/) I’ve mentioned before, you learn the whole command line before getting to use Docker Compose which I believe is invaluable to the process. I would do that here but it would take another whole module and that’s not what you’re here for so I’ve elected to approach the subject through the project at hand.
