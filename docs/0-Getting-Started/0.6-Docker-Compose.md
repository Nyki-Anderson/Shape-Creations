# 0.6-Docker-Compose  
  
---  
  
## Overview  
  
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a wonderful tool that is used to build and run multi-container Docker projects in one step. It provides a more readable and portable experience when building our images and designing our container runtime behaviors. Anything that can be accomplished in the Docker CLI can be done in a Docker Compose configuration file. Docker Compose is now an extension of Docker itself and has its own syntax.  
  
You can get help for any `docker compose` commands using the `--help` flag just as with any other Docker command.  
  
```shell  
$ docker compose --help  
```  
  
> 🔮 Crystal Ball    
> While Docker Compose relieves us of the need to use Docker fully in the command line, I will attempt to show the equivalent commands to give us some perspective on how helpful the tool really is.    
  
## The `docker-compose.yml` File  
  
The Docker Compose configuration file is written in yaml format which has super easy to learn, element-/attribute-based syntax. This file is generally named `compose.yml` or `docker-compose.yml` but the `docker compose...` command can accept any yaml file using the `-f` flag.  
  
Here is an excerpt from a typical `docker-compose.yml`.  
  
```yml  
version: '3.8'  
services:  
	frontend:  
		image: httpd:2.4.5  
	backend:  
		build:  
			context: .  
			dockerfile: Dockerfiles/dockerfile  
```  
  
## Elements & Attributes  
  
There are many possible elements/attributes but not every service will need the same ones, the build is as customizable as possible. We will go through the most important ones, especially those we will make use of through this project. For a complete list of all elements and attributes, visit the [Docker Compose Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)  
  
### Top-Level Elements  
  
Top-level elements are not indented and define high-level aspects of the project. They should be justified to the far left of the yaml file. There can be space between the start of each top-level element but it is not necessary, the yaml parser is mostly concerned with white space and tabbed indents.  
  
#### Version  
  
While not required it is good practice to begin your Docker Compose file with the version with which you want it to be parsed. At the time of this tutorial, Docker Compose is on version 3.8.  
  
```yaml  
version: 3.8  
```  
  
#### Services  
  
Every Docker Compose file must include the `services` element. We have used the word **services** throughout this project to describe the various containers we require. This is where we get the term from.  
  
> 🍎 Definition    
> **Services**: A service is an abstract concept. Think of services like resources that can be scaled and configured to your exact specifications. They are our web servers, interpreters, and database management programs: i.e., apache, php, mariadb, etc.
