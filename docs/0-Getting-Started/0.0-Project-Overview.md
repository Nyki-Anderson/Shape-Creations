## Shape Creations : A Dockerized Web Application  
  
Shape Creations is a project built around an in-depth tutorial. Throughout this tutorial we will learn how to configure and build Docker containers that are secure, leave a small footprint, and house a dynamic web application. The focus will not be on the exact features of the web application, as this part of the project will be open-ended; it is meant to grow in perpetuity until we are satisfied with the results.  
  
Instead we will design carefully crafted services that are hardened against attacks and impervious to traffic sniffers. Shape Creations is simply put, an exercise in security. Now, you don’t have to care about these attributes, per se, but they will be the driving force behind many of the decisions we make.  
  
That being said, let’s discuss some specifics regarding the project’s evolution, its intended trajectory, and how you can best move through this tutorial.  
  
### The Project’s Evolution  
  
It is as true here as it always is, the journey is more important than the destination. A while ago, I set out to design a web application based in a [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org) stack like I had learned in school. I wanted to just start out and see what kind of features I could include; really let the project take on a life of its own. So that’s what I did! This first iteration was named [Shape_Search](https://github.com/Nyki-Anderson/shape_search) and it was a valiant effort but I was really just shooting around in the dark. I made heavy use of the PHP framework [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/) which handled a lot of the security options for me (thankfully...) and I’m not embarrassed to say I was a bit of a *script-kitty*.  
  
Fast-forward a few months and I was tired of relying on frameworks and other GitHub users to do all the work for me! Throughout Shape_Search I became fascinated with configuration and especially security: SSL certificates, CSRF tokens, encryption, etc. I decided I didn’t want to just make a web application, I wanted to make a safe one. And I wanted it to be *my code*.  
  
Somehow I heard about Docker and using something called containers to run all the applications that were in my current stack but with some real control and ownership. Soon I was knee deep in documentation, jumping from topic to topic with no real direction to speak of. I tried finding tutorials and examples for setting up my own containers. I poured through best practices and searched the entire IoT for my specific requirements: an Apache server, a PHP interpreter, a MariaDB database, and the security forward version, but only found bits and pieces here and there. Nothing comprehensive.  
  
I had containers running one minute, stopping the next, and none of the services were communicating with the others. My project was becoming bloated as more and more failed attempts began to accumulate in my directory. So I put the project aside for the school year and got back into the zone of writing my own code. I purchased a Udemy course about Docker (on sale of course) and decided I would take a step back when summer comes around again and do the    
course. So I did.  
  
And voila! A few weeks later, I had all my images configured and built with a fair amount of hardening already done. My containers were running and for once they all talked to each other! The lesson to be learned here is sometimes, when a problem is so complex you have to take a step back, do the work yourself, and take that dang Udemy course.  
  
### What is the Vision?  
  
Sure, you are here to build a web application using `Docker`, `Apache`, `PHP`, and `MariaDB` (with a little help from `PHPMyAdmin`). That is what we will be doing throughout the course of this tutorial. However, I know from my own trial and error that copying and pasting some code posted on `GitHub` is an easy trap to fall into. A trap that leads to broken scripts, mismatched configurations, and code that is legit, all over the place!  
  
That’s why in this tutorial, if you choose to follow along, I will do my best to impart my accumulated wisdom, after having failed in every way possible. To warn you about the gotchas while explaining the nuances that will help you to *understand* your code once you’re done with it. I could not find the tutorial I was looking for, so the vision is that this become that tutorial we all needed.  
  
## Project Specifics  
  
Now that we have established our values and motivations, we can move to the project specifics. At first, we have two distinct stages of development: (1) the docker configuration phase and (2) the web application building phase. We cannot start on the web application until we at least have a rudimentary Docker instance running.  
  
However, we may need to return to either phase multiple times throughout the rest of the development process to ensure we maintain the integrity of the project as a whole. If one is insecure, the other is compromised and vise versa. Security will be an ongoing process throughout the lifetime of the project. This mindset will guide us and even has a name, DevSecOps (acronym for **D**evelopment, **S**ecurity, and **O**perations).  
  
### Docker Features  
  
We will make every effort to configure our four main services (Apache, PHP, MariaDB, and PHPMyAdmin) with as many baked in security features as possible. We will be assessing their resilience to attack vectors, unauthorized accesses (whether programmatic or forced), and other security dysfunctions at various points in our development process. I have even arranged for a trained penetration tester to poke at our project in order to discover hidden vulnerabilities.  
  
Listed are some key features that we will be implementing during the Docker configuration stages :  
  
- Serve site over HTTPS/SSL port `443`  
- Serve site using virtual host `shapecreations.com`  
- Enable PHP files to be served by Apache  
- Encrypt MariaDB tables both at-rest and in-transit  
- Restrict default users in all services (no root access)  
- Isolate the PHPMyAdmin service and ensure it is never running when not in use  
- Grant limited credential permissions to select services via Docker Secrets  
  
### Web Application Features  
  
Once we have our Docker services running roughly secure as outlined in the previous section, we can start the web application build phase. For this, we will need a slightly different approach in order to ensure it too is designed security-first. This phase is all about obfuscation and user input control (i.e., escaping variables, form validation rules, and strict request restrictions).  
  
Obfuscation is important when designing data table schema, variable names, and any other information that is in transit or dynamic. As an example, it would be more secure to name our data table something non-standard such as `creations` instead of `shapcreations`, or even better, just `scr`. This way, malicious users cannot guess our table name and perform an SQL injection attack. If we keep a suspicious mind, we can harden our web application innately.  
  
Some key features we will implement in this build phase are :  
  
- Design data table schema for each of three user tiers, creation uploads, and user interaction types  
- Develop strict user input validation rules for each form type  
- Escape all PHP variables used within HTML files  
- Use the MVC framework to interrupt flow of user input to the data bases directly (very important, more on this later)  
- Establish `.css` theme for both light and dark mode  
- Limit use of `GET` requests and Javascript  
- Generate and pass CSRF tokens  
  
## Tutorial Overview  
  
The tutorial itself is organized into numbered Modules or folders and nested Sections or files. For example:  
  
Module 0 - Section 0 can be found in the `./docs/0_Getting_Started/0.0_Project_Overview.md` file  
  
### Tentative Goals for Each Module  
  
Since the project itself is live, I cannot enumerate how many Modules and Sections it will eventually become but each Module will be roughly aligned with a certain goal that will be achieved by its conclusion. For now I will list some of these goals and do my best to keep to this plan throughout the lifetime of the project. Any edits will be logged in the `./docs/EDIT.md` file and will be marked clearly as such in the edited file.  
  
| Module | Folder                          | Goal Description                                                                                                                               |

| 5      | `./docs/5-Interactions`         | Allow standard users to interact with creators’ content and profiles.                                                                                                                                               |  
  
### Formatting Conventions  
  
I have developed a cheat-sheet for the formatting conventions that I will use within these `.md` files. Please refer to this page if you are unclear how a formatting typeface, callout, etc. is being used.  
  
### Typeface  
  
| Type of Text  | Corresponding Information                              |  
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |  
| **bold**      | Concept or term that will be defined soon              |  
| *italic*      | Simple emphasis or caveat                              |  
| `inline code` | Code snippet or file/directory                         |  
| [Links](Links.md#)     | Navigation both inside the tutorial and external sites |

## Some Considerations  
  
This will be a highly technical project and may require many rewrites on my end if I have been found too vague or skip a crucial step in my explanations or demos. As such, I will be very open to constructive criticisms or pointers on where this tutorial can be improved. Please leave a comment in the Discussions section of this GitHub repository.
