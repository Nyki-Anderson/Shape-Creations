title: 0.4-Docker-CLI  
description: In this Section, we will explore the Docker CLI. You will learn to  
  pull images from the DockerHub as well as build them with the use of a  
  Dockerfile. You will also learn how to run and start containers from the  
  command line. The Docker CLI is very robust but you will become an expert  
  simply through repetition, I promise!

## Overview  
  
We will now get to brass tax and start working with our newly installed Docker Engine. This section will continue to expand on our Docker knowledge-base with a few more necessary concepts and tools that will make our lives a whole lot easier. But as is usually the way, we must push through the tedious method before we can appreciate the *shortcuts*.  
  
> ⚠ Warning!    
> Do not skip through this section. This Section, more than any of its predecessors, will be interlaced with tips and caveats, without which you will almost certainly have difficulty when we start developing Shape Creations.  
>  
> Docker is not perfect but it is a machine. In all its complexity, it has a simple set of underlying rules that govern its behavior. If you learn the rules, you can better manipulate it to achieve your goals. But enough serious talk though, let’s get to it!  
  
## Forget Something?  
  
As we start to pile on the Docker CLI commands, you may experience some harmless amnesia. Docker CLI is an extensive web of commands, the vast majority of which you will never need to use. Thankfully, if you’re ever in doubt, you can append the `--help` flag to the end of any command. Docker will output a detailed list of acceptable options and commands that are related to what you already entered.  
  
```shell  
$ docker --help  
```  
  
OR  
  
```shell  
$ docker logs --help  
```  
  
<details>  
	<summary>Expected Output</summary>  
  
```shell  
Usage:  docker logs [OPTIONS] CONTAINER  
  
Fetch the logs of a container  
  
Aliases:  
  docker container logs, docker logs  
  
Options:  
      --details        Show extra details provided to logs  
  -f, --follow         Follow log output  
      --since string   Show logs since timestamp (e.g.  
                       "2013-01-02T13:23:37Z") or relative (e.g. "42m"  
                       for 42 minutes)  
  -n, --tail string    Number of lines to show from the end of the logs  
                       (default "all")  
  -t, --timestamps     Show timestamps  
      --until string   Show logs before a timestamp (e.g.  
                       "2013-01-02T13:23:37Z") or relative (e.g. "42m"  
                       for 42 minutes)  
```  
  
</detail>  
  
## Building Images  
  
If you recall, Docker images are built using base images found in a repository called [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) which can be appended with our personal configuration using something called a `Dockerfile`. All but one of our services will require its own `Dockerfile` so we will need to tackle this soon.  
  
For now, let’s test out our Docker installment with the obligatory `hello-world` image.  
  
> ⚠ Warning!    
> Remember how I said when you create a free account you have unlimited public images and only one private image? Well, imagine that anyone can make an account and anyone can host unlimited public images; without any review!  
>  
> Images on the DockerHub site are not to be trusted unless they have a Docker Official Image banner.[^1] Thankfully, the good old boys at Docker introduced some order in the chaos. Any image with the badge shown below has undergone a rigorous proposal process that checked its contents for malicious code, an unnecessarily large footprint, and that it does what it says it does.  
>  
> The DockerHub is a landmine and don’t ever forget it!

### Testing Our Installation with `hello-world`  
  
If you don’t require a dedicated `Dockerfile` and have found a suitable and verified image from DockerHub, you can use the command `docker pull IMAGE_NAME:VERSION` command to At your command line prompt issue the following command :  
  
```shell  
$ docker pull hello-world  
```  
  
<details>  
	<summary>Expected Output</summary>  
  
```shell  
Using default tag: latest  
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world  
719385e32844: Pull complete  
Digest: sha256:fc6cf906cbfa013e80938cdf0bb199fbdbb86d6e3e013783e5a766f50f5dbce0  
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

```
