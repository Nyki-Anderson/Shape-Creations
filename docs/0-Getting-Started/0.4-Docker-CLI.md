description: Before we introduce orchestration tools to build, start, and stop  
  our containers, we should become familiar with the Docker CLI. You will become  
  an expert simply through repetition, I promise! You do not want to skip this  
  Section because I will also be enumerating the dockerisms that dictate those  
  tools as well.
